# Abstract

Have you ever made a request to an API that returns 20 data points to get the one value you needed?

Have you built pages that needed to make 10+ HTTP requests just to render correctly?

Have you ever resorted to scanning through your backend code to figure out how to call an API because the docs are out of date or non-existent?

GraphQL is an insanely powerful technology that can painlessly solve these problems and many more. We will explore how GraphQL works under the hood and see how we can leverage it to reduce headaches and ship on time.
